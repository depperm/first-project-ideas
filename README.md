# First? Project Ideas
So you've completed a course, tutorial, or are just plain bored and want to see what you can do with your knowledge you've acquired, except you don't know how to demonstrate all your ideas and concepts you've filled your head with. Worry not, for here is a list of ideas that anyone can try. Don't like what you see, worry not, contained within are links to several other lists and sites with more possibilities.

This repo is inspired from [awesome-app-ideas](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas) which hasn't seen any changes in three years. Hopefully this list will provide ideas for those looking to showcase their skills. Dosed heavily with sarcasm and satire to make the list more memorable.

## Visual/GUI Oriented

### Simple Games*
Games are fun. Making them is sooo simple. Start on of these projects and soon enough you'll be playing a AAA level game because you'll want to relax after searching for ten hours for a typo in your code that breaks everything occasionally, but frequently enough make the game unplayable and to drive you crazy.
- Arcade Shooter

    Fly around while blasting enemies that conveniently line up in groups and don't dodge. Sound too simple? Then add upgrades, high score, multiple/endless levels, and other totally unique ideas.
- Asteroids

    Pew, pew, pew. Shoot bullets from a triangle(ship) to destroy low poly circles (asteroids) and trapezoids(alien). Score arbitary points, fly around, and most important don't die like your bullets will.
- Brick Break

    Since early gaming was around, [aquanoid](https://www.playdosgames.com/online/aquanoid/) has shown us that mankind likes to break things, specifically bricks. You know you want to break bricks so why not make some bricks to break.
- Frogger

    Why did the chicken cross the road, because the frog couldn't. Honestly just help the frog cross the road, and avoid those cars.
- Game Jam

    Sometimes all you need is a random idea and a deadline to really squeeze a project out. There are hundreds of game jams to choose from, and you will hopefully be able to produce something unique as well. Thousands of monkeys pounding on typewriters will eventually produce a shakespearean work, just think you could be that monkey.
    - [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/)
    - [itch.io jams](https://itch.io/jams)
    - [indie game jams](http://www.indiegamejams.com/)

- Minesweeper

    A grid with some number of hidden mines. Click to clear areas, see nearby mines, flag mines, or EXPLODE.
- Pacman

    Be a lemon pie, lose a slice, gain the slice back. Now move around eating dots while being chased by ghosts. Eat fruit to be able to eat ghosts. This game really makes no sense.
- Pong

    One of the oldest of video games, this sure needs an upgrade like computer player, difficulty, color, sound, lights.... [the game](https://www.ponggame.org)
- Scattergories

    Generate 12 random topics (ice cream flavor, programming language, etc), a random letter, and set a timer. [the game](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/)
- Snake

    Slither around and eat apples, cause that's what snakes do. Grow proportion to the amount you eat, but don't eat yourself. [the game](https://g.co/kgs/PwYZXz) (this one is by google, so it *definetly needs work*)
- Tic Tac Toe

    Three by three grid, Xs and Os, alternating turns, three in a row for a win ... does this need more of an explanation [the game](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic%20tac%20toe)
- Tetris

    Every configuration of four blocks orthogonally connected, you control their fall downward, complete rows, and keep it from reaching the top. Did I mention it gets faster the longer you play.

### Recreate the Greats
These are massive undertakings, but the best form of flattery is imitation. Like only do these if you want to work on something for a looooong time or like inflicting torture on your mind.
- Social Board

    Everyone wants to share personal information, but not just a single place. Make Face-page where anyone can share information that they probably shouldn't.
- QA Engine

    Everyone loves [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)? Can you create an app that mimics the base features: users can ask questions, users can answer questions, and users can vote on both. Do you want to up the difficulty and tort....showcase your skills, add in more of the features (user accounts, tags, reviewing, comments, etc)
- Seenit

    Have a question that nobody else can answer? What to answer questions about particular r/ subjects? Don't trust the internet, then make your own. Make a place where you are control.
- Wikiwannabe

    Who hasn't used this unofficial source while researching some topic. Just think your own personal wiki that contains all that you know, this should be easy.

### Other
- Boids

    Birds of a feather flock together. Who goes outside to see that though when you can simulate that on your computer screen.
- Budget/Expenses Tracker

    [Don't buy stuff you can't afford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ZJKN_5M44&t=3s). How do you know what you can't afford, track your expenses. Adding fun charts always makes a project look nicer.
- Calculator

    Calculate math equations solutions so you don't have to in your head. Varying degrees of difficulty:
    1. Simple Calculator with Standard functions (Start->Windows Accessories->Calculator)
    2. Graphing/plotting
    3. Reverse calculations (quadratic formula, line of best fit...TI-83 stuff)
- Calorie Counter/Weight Tracker

    Everyone wants to lose something sometime. Let users tediously enter calories so they can track their eaten calories. They should also be able to enter their weight at varying time, vague exercise (calorie output), and have nice charts.
- Converter

    Does a chocolate chip cookie have more energy than TNT. Don't google it, create a converter to convert from one format to another. Euros to dollars, pounds to kilos, calories to energy, inches to centimeters, or something else. Convert your boring life to one full of stress debugging this doozy.
- Death Clock/Calculator

    Predicate when you will die based on statistics for your age, gender, habits, and location. Expected use would be to change ones conditions to have a later death date, get that high score.
- Diceware Generator

    ![XKCD password complexity!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png "XKCD password complexity")

    [In-depth explanation](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) This isn't necessarily the most exciting app so spruce this up with a nice GUI and options (character replacing, number of words, etc)
- Editor

    From the simple [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) to the sophisticated vim, everyone loves opening, editing, and saving documents. If this seems like an easy project(I don't think you fully grasp the complexity), add complexity by adding additional features (multiple file extension support, find/replace, syntax highlighting). Make sure you can use it any where by making it cross platform, if you really want to make this project bigger.
- Fund comparison

    Don't know how best to invest your hard earned money. Don't believe a trusted financial planner, instead make a totally safe app that can compare any ETF, mutual fund, stock, etc. Plan how to use money you don't have yet, by relying on a *stable* market.
- Game of Life

    Think your life is the most boring. Make this to prove to yourself that something else holds that spot. Two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

    1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

    [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
- Goal Planner

    You're looking for a project to do, why not set a goal. How? Make a program to help you set and keep your goals, make sure the algorithm is SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, timely)
- Meal Planner

    Maybe an extension of a recipe organizer, plan a weeks worth of meals. Enter your fridge's contents, enter a meal that matches ingredients, automatically adjust food levels, select new meal, repeat, and then produce a shopping list. Should be really useful if ever completed.
- Medicine Tracker
Its like the [remembrall](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall) except only for medicine ... with a few other features.
- Recipe Organizer

    You don't have your mom's cookbook, but you do have a bunch of pinterest pins that look good, why not organize them in a single place (not pinterest obviously)? Make sure a user can modify ingredient amounts from single servings when I'm home alone and unsure about a recipe to a quadruple batch when I'm home alone and really hungry.
- Typing Test

    Want to measure how fast you actually are when you sit in front of your computer? No, well some people do, and to do that we need to measure how much they type, over a period of time, while counting typos.
- Workout Creator

    There are lots of workouts out there. If you made a program to generate workouts based on time, muscle groups, and type (HITT, cardio, weight, etc) you could probably create and have all known workouts.

## Algorithm Challenges
There are other challenges out there beyond these listed on such sites like: ,  or 

### Procedural Generation
- Maze generation

    Lose track of time by getting lost in the code to generate amazing mazes.
- Markov Generator

    Can you guess what someone is going to say n... Jinx! This basically guesses for you.
- PRNG

    Ever want to get a random choice? Dive into how random numbers are generated and make your own generator. Maybe its xorshift, mersenne twiser, linear congruential generators, or something else. Be random.

### Other Algorithms
- Knapsack

    What is the most ebooks you can buy with x dollars (pages per dollar)? What is the most hot dogs you can get with x dollars? These are all very important questions. This algorithm can tell you these important answers if you do it right.
- Sudoku Generator/Solver

    Nine by nine grid, filled with one through nine with each row, column, and block(3x3) containing no repeats. Nein, nine isn't used too much. *Start creating the solver first.*
- TOTP Generator

    You know those 6 digit random digits that change every 30 seconds to verify that you are you, well someone needs to generate them.

## Multi Component
Think single user interaction is basic, try multiplayer, server/client, or user interaction.

- Fantasy Football

    Create imaginary teams with definitely real people. Create this app to manage and track your friends...team.
- Kanban board

    You've selected an idea and now need to keep yourself and/or team organized, but alas [trello](https://trello.com) is too complicated. Why not create a simpler version, like a much simpler version.
- Messaging app

    Why rely on legacy, bloated apps that everyone uses to message others? Why not create a minimal, bug...feature filled app to message those closest to you.
- Poll taker

    Which app should you do? Why not take a poll ... with what you may ask, well do I have a project idea for you. Make sure each poll has a topic, voters are unique, and stats are ready for the poll giver to quickly see results.
- Wishlist

    Never know what to get people, or track things you'd still like to get while remaining surprised, then make a way to track these things. Create a list, share it with others, they can mark what they plan on getting, and it will only update other's views not the receiver's view.

## Language/Device Specific
See also: [Open Source Help](#open-source-help)
- Chatbot <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/python/yellow">

    Just because you don't like talking to humans doesn't mean there isn't someone out there who does. Why not create a new friend for them. [docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)?
- Chrome Extension <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/javascript/yellow">

    Think of literally anything (like any of these ideas) and try to create a chrome extension of it.
- NPM Library <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/javascript/yellow"><img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/npm/red?icon=npm">

    First think of a great idea like [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even). Then make a package so others live's can be easier than yours was before your addition.
- OCR Scanner <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/camera/grey">

    Have an artifact, such as a printout/piece of paper, with text that needs to be transfered over to the 21st century. *This is a great project if you want to search for a word but don't actually want to read the whole document. Definitely faster to make a program do this for you as opposed to just reading it.* 

    [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
- Pedometer <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/mobile/white"><img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/iot/blue">

    You know where you are, you know where you came from, but do you know how you got there exactly (was it 20 or just 19 steps)?
- QR Scanner <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/camera/grey">

    Are QR codes still a thing? Just in case make something that can read them because you sure can't. If they aren't a thing, you better make something that can make a QR code.

## Open Source Help
Why start from scratch. Find someone else's project that got out of hand and help them wrangle the beast.
