# First Project Ideas
So you've completed a course, tutorial, or are just plain bored and want to see what you can do with your knowledge you've acquired, except you don't know how to demonstrate all your ideas and concepts you've filled your head with. Worry not, for here is a list of ideas that anyone can try.

This repo is inspired from [awesome-app-ideas](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas) which hasn't seen any changes in three years. Hopefully this list will provide ideas for those looking to showcase their skills.

## Self Contained
### Calculator
Calculate math equations solutions so you don't have to. Varying degrees of difficulty:
1. Simple Calculator with Standard functions (Start->Windows Accessories->Calculator)
2. Other Operations (graphing, plotting, TI-83 stuff)
### Camera Input
#### QR Scanner
#### OCR Scanner
Have an artifact, such as a printout, with text that needs to be transfered over to the 21st century. *This is a great project if you want to search for a word but don't actually want to read the whole document.*

### Diceware Generator
![XKCD password complexity!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png "XKCD password complexity")

[In-depth explanation](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) This isn't necessarily the most exciting app so spruce this up with a nice GUI and options (character replacing, number of words, etc)
### Editor
From the simple [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) to the sophisticated vim, everyone loves opening, editing, and saving documents. If this seems like an easy project, add complexity by adding additional features (multiple file extension support, find/replace, syntax highlighting)
### Game of Life
Two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Medicine Tracker
Its like the [remembrall](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall) except only for medicine ... with a few other features.
### Pedometer
You know where you are, you know where you came from, but do you know how you got there exactly (was it 20 or just 19 steps)?
### Simple* Game
#### Arcade Shooter
Fly around while blasting enemies that convenient line up in groups and don't dodge. Sound too simple then add upgrades, high score, multiple/endless levels, and other totally unique ideas.
#### Asteroids
Pew, pew, pew. Shoot bullets from a triangle(ship) to destroy low poly circles (asteroids) and trapezoids(alien). Score arbitary points, fly around, and most important don't die like your bullets will.
#### Brick Break
Since early gaming was around, [aquanoid](https://www.playdosgames.com/online/aquanoid/) has shown us that mankind likes to break things, specifically bricks. You know you want to break bricks so why not make some bricks to break.
#### Frogger
Why did the chicken cross the road, because the frog couldn't. Honestly just help the frog cross the road, and avoid those cars.
#### Minesweeper
A grid with some number of hidden mines. Click to clear areas, see nearby mines, flag mines, or EXPLODE.
#### Pong
One of the oldest of video games, this sure needs an upgrade like computer player, difficulty, color, sound, lights.... [the game](https://www.ponggame.org)
#### Scattergories
Generate 12 random topics (ice cream flavor, programming language, etc), a random letter, and set a timer. [the game](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/)
#### Tic Tac Toe
Three by three grid, Xs and Os, alternating turns, three in a row for a win ... does this need more of an explanation [the game](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic%20tac%20toe)
#### Tetris
### Sudoku Generator/Solver
Nine by nine grid, filled with one through nine with each row, column, and block containing no repeats. Nein, nine isn't used too much. *Start creating the solver first.*
### TOTP Generator
You know those 6 digit random digits that change every 30 seconds to verify that you are you, well someone needs to generate them.
### Typing Test
Want to measure how fast you actually are when you sit in front of your computer? No, well some people do, and to do that we need to measure how much they type, over a period of time, while counting typos.

## Complex Storage
### Budget/Expenses Tracker
[Don't buy stuff you can't afford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ZJKN_5M44&t=3s). How do you know what you can't afford, track your expenses. Adding fun charts always makes a project look nicer.
### Calorie Counter/Weight Tracker
Everyone wants to lose something sometime. Let users tediously enter calories so they can track their weight. They should also be able to enter their weight at varying time, vague exercise (calorie output), and have nice charts.
### QA Engine
Everyone loves [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)? Can you create an app that mimics the base features: users can ask questions, users can answer questions, and users can vote on both. Do you want to up the difficulty and tort....showcase your skills, add in more of the features (user accounts, tags, reviewing, comments, etc)
### Recipe Organizer
You don't have your mom's cookbook, but you do have a bunch of pinterest pins that look good. Why not organize them in a single place? Make sure I can modify ingredient amounts from single servings when I'm home alone and unsure about a recipe to a quadruple batch when I'm home alone and really hungry.

## External API
### Chatbot
Just because you don't like talking to humans doesn't mean there isn't someone out there who does. Why not create a new friend for them.

## Multiuser Interactive
### Fantasy Football
Create imaginary teams with definitely real people. Create this app to manage and track your friends...team.
### Kanban board
You've selected an idea and now need to keep yourself and/or team organized, but alas [trello](https://trello.com) is too complicated. Why not create a simpler version, like a much simpler version.
### Messaging app
Why rely on legacy, bloated apps that everyone uses to message others? Why not create a minimal, bug...feature filled app to message those closest to you.
### Poll taker
Which app should you do? Why not take a poll ... with what you may ask, well do I have a project idea for you. Make sure each poll has a topic, voters are unique, and stats are ready for the poll giver to quickly see results.
