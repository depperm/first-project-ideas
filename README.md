# First? Project Ideas
So you've completed a course, tutorial, or are just plain bored and want to see what you can do with your knowledge you've acquired, except you don't know how to demonstrate all your ideas and concepts you've filled your head with. Worry not, for here is a list of ideas that anyone can try.

This repo is inspired from [awesome-app-ideas](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas) which hasn't seen any changes in three years. Hopefully this list will provide ideas for those looking to showcase their skills. Dosed heavily with sarcasm and satire to make the list more memorable.

## Visual/GUI Oriented

### Simple Games*
Games are fun. Making them is sooo simple. Start on of these projects and soon enough you'll be playing a AAA level game because you'll want to relax after searching for ten hours for a typo in your code that breaks everything occasionally, but frequently enough make the game unplayable and to drive you crazy.
#### Arcade Shooter
Fly around while blasting enemies that conveniently line up in groups and don't dodge. Sound too simple? Then add upgrades, high score, multiple/endless levels, and other totally unique ideas.
#### Asteroids
Pew, pew, pew. Shoot bullets from a triangle(ship) to destroy low poly circles (asteroids) and trapezoids(alien). Score arbitary points, fly around, and most important don't die like your bullets will.
#### Brick Break
Since early gaming was around, [aquanoid](https://www.playdosgames.com/online/aquanoid/) has shown us that mankind likes to break things, specifically bricks. You know you want to break bricks so why not make some bricks to break.
#### Frogger
Why did the chicken cross the road, because the frog couldn't. Honestly just help the frog cross the road, and avoid those cars.
#### Minesweeper
A grid with some number of hidden mines. Click to clear areas, see nearby mines, flag mines, or EXPLODE.
#### Pacman
Be a lemon pie, lose a slice, gain the slice back. Now move around eating dots while being chased by ghosts. Eat fruit to be able to eat ghosts. This game really makes no sense.
#### Pong
One of the oldest of video games, this sure needs an upgrade like computer player, difficulty, color, sound, lights.... [the game](https://www.ponggame.org)
#### Scattergories
Generate 12 random topics (ice cream flavor, programming language, etc), a random letter, and set a timer. [the game](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/)
#### Snake
Slither around and eat apples, cause that's what snakes do. Grow proportion to the amount you eat, but don't eat yourself. [the game](https://g.co/kgs/PwYZXz) (this one is by google, so it *definetly needs work*)
#### Tic Tac Toe
Three by three grid, Xs and Os, alternating turns, three in a row for a win ... does this need more of an explanation [the game](https://www.google.com/search?q=tic%20tac%20toe)
#### Tetris
Every configuration of four blocks orthogonally connected, you control their fall downward, complete rows, and keep it from reaching the top. Did I mention it gets faster the longer you play.
### Recreate the Greats
#### QA Engine
Everyone loves [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)? Can you create an app that mimics the base features: users can ask questions, users can answer questions, and users can vote on both. Do you want to up the difficulty and tort....showcase your skills, add in more of the features (user accounts, tags, reviewing, comments, etc)
### Other
#### Budget/Expenses Tracker
[Don't buy stuff you can't afford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ZJKN_5M44&t=3s). How do you know what you can't afford, track your expenses. Adding fun charts always makes a project look nicer.
#### Calculator
Calculate math equations solutions so you don't have to in your head. Varying degrees of difficulty:
1. Simple Calculator with Standard functions (Start->Windows Accessories->Calculator)
2. Graphing/plotting
3. Reverse calculations (quadratic formula, line of best fit...TI-83 stuff)
#### Calorie Counter/Weight Tracker
Everyone wants to lose something sometime. Let users tediously enter calories so they can track their eaten calories. They should also be able to enter their weight at varying time, vague exercise (calorie output), and have nice charts.
#### Diceware Generator
![XKCD password complexity!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png "XKCD password complexity")

[In-depth explanation](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) This isn't necessarily the most exciting app so spruce this up with a nice GUI and options (character replacing, number of words, etc)
#### Editor
From the simple [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) to the sophisticated vim, everyone loves opening, editing, and saving documents. If this seems like an easy project(I don't think you fully grasp the complexity), add complexity by adding additional features (multiple file extension support, find/replace, syntax highlighting). Make sure you can use it any where by making it cross platform, if you really want to make this project bigger.
#### Game of Life
Think your life is the most boring. Make this to prove to yourself that something else holds that spot. Two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
#### Medicine Tracker
Its like the [remembrall](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Remembrall) except only for medicine ... with a few other features.
#### Recipe Organizer
You don't have your mom's cookbook, but you do have a bunch of pinterest pins that look good, why not organize them in a single place (not pinterest obviously)? Make sure a user can modify ingredient amounts from single servings when I'm home alone and unsure about a recipe to a quadruple batch when I'm home alone and really hungry.
#### Typing Test
Want to measure how fast you actually are when you sit in front of your computer? No, well some people do, and to do that we need to measure how much they type, over a period of time, while counting typos.

## Algorithm Challenges
There are other challenges out there beyond these listed on such sites like: [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
#### A*
#### Maze generation
#### Markov Generator
#### Sudoku Generator/Solver
Nine by nine grid, filled with one through nine with each row, column, and block(3x3) containing no repeats. Nein, nine isn't used too much. *Start creating the solver first.*
#### TOTP Generator
You know those 6 digit random digits that change every 30 seconds to verify that you are you, well someone needs to generate them.

## Multi Component
Think single user interaction is basic, try multiplayer, server/client, or user interaction.

### Fantasy Football
Create imaginary teams with definitely real people. Create this app to manage and track your friends...team.
#### Kanban board
You've selected an idea and now need to keep yourself and/or team organized, but alas [trello](https://trello.com) is too complicated. Why not create a simpler version, like a much simpler version.
#### Messaging app
Why rely on legacy, bloated apps that everyone uses to message others? Why not create a minimal, bug...feature filled app to message those closest to you.
#### Poll taker
Which app should you do? Why not take a poll ... with what you may ask, well do I have a project idea for you. Make sure each poll has a topic, voters are unique, and stats are ready for the poll giver to quickly see results.

## Language/Device Specific

#### Chatbot <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/python/yellow">
Just because you don't like talking to humans doesn't mean there isn't someone out there who does. Why not create a new friend for them. [docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)?
#### Chrome Extension <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/javascript/yellow">
Think of literally anything (like any of these ideas) and try to create a chrome extension of it.
#### NPM Library <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/javascript/yellow"><img src="https://badgen.net/badge/language/npm/red?icon=npm">
First think of a great idea like [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even). Then make a package so others live's can be easier than yours was before your addition.
#### OCR Scanner <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/camera/grey">
Have an artifact, such as a printout/piece of paper, with text that needs to be transfered over to the 21st century. *This is a great project if you want to search for a word but don't actually want to read the whole document. Definitely faster to make a program do this for you as opposed to just reading it.* 

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
#### Pedometer <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/mobile/white"><img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/iot/blue">
You know where you are, you know where you came from, but do you know how you got there exactly (was it 20 or just 19 steps)?
#### QR Scanner <img src="https://badgen.net/badge/device/camera/grey">
Are QR codes still a thing? Just in case make something that can read them because you sure can't. If they aren't a thing, you better make something that can make a QR code.

## Open Source Help
Why start from scratch. Find someone else's project that got out of hand and help them wrangle the beast.
